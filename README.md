Finally finished the flexbox and grid sections to begin my project. Just setting up the basics for now.

GOt a good chunk of work done imho. Gotta figure out the icons on those <a> tags so I can have the corresponding social media icons working... also my webpage is significantly smaller than the original, need to find out where the re-sizing is messing up.

I had a lot going on this week and had to postpone working on this till Satuday. This has been a fun challenge but it really is starting to drag on. I've realized how big of a mistake I made not implementing Grid more, I feel like it would have sped up the ending a lot faster. I am happy overall that this has made me make a good habit out of flex box, it has made aligning and moving things so so so much easier. I do need to implement grid more.
