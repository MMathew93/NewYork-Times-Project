                            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
                            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
                            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.

                            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
                            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he 
                            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
                            A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could 
                            have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a 
                            repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
                            of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                             look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. 
                             The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. 
                             Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, 
                             like spit in the ocean.

                            known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                            with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac 
                            of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the 
                            fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a 
                            universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of 
                            a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought 
                            smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, 
                            that Dr. Guth was correct.

                            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, 
                            including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.

                            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science 
                            comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe 
                            apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and 
                            space and energy to science and speculation.

                            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14

                            is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture 
                            and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an 
                            endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot
